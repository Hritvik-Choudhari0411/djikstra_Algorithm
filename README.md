# Djikstra_Algorithm
Implementation of Djikstra's path planning algorithm using python

Installation
Install the below libraries to run the code without issues.
- opencv-contrib-python
- matplotlib
- numpy

Install all libraries using the command below and replace `<name>` with above options.
```
pip3 install <name>
```
# Code run
To run the code file, run command:
```
djikstra_hritvik_choudhari.py
```

- Enter the x-y coordinates of the start node and the goal node. 

- Test Case 1: start_x: 10, start_y: 10 , goal_x: 520, goal_y: 125
- Test Case 2: start_x: 10, start_y: 10 , goal_x: 170, goal_y: 175

The video would be saved in the same folder that visualizes the nodes explored by the algorithm and the shortest path as well using backtracking.
